NOTE (2024/8): Organizing codes/scripts and populating guidelines/artifacts is time-consuming and dirty work.
We are always trying to polish this repo. However, since the students are all busy with internships
this summer, our time is limited. Please bear with us, and don't hesitate to reach out to me (wangm12@uchicago.edu)
if you have any questions.
